Hive is an open-source data warehousing system, which is exclusively used to query and analyze huge datasets stored in Hadoop. The three important 
functionalities for which Hive is deployed are data summarization, data analysis, and data query. ... HiveQL also supports MapReduce scripts that can be 
plugged into the queries.
Today, Hadoop has the privilege of being one of the most widespread technologies when it comes to crunching huge amounts of Big Data. Hadoop is like an 
ocean with a vast array of tools and technologies that are exclusively associated with it. One such technology is Apache Hive. Apache Hive is a Hadoop 
component that is normally deployed by data analysts. Even though Apache Pig can also be deployed for the same purpose, Hive is used more by researchers 
and programmers. It is an open-source data warehousing system, which is exclusively used to query and analyze huge datasets stored in Hadoop.
One of the most important features of HBase is that it can handle data sets which number in billions of rows and millions of columns. It can 
extremely well combine the various data sources that are coming from a wide variety of types, structures and schemas
The Apache HBase carries all the features of the original Google Bigtable paper like the Bloom filters, in-memory operations and compression. 
The tables of this database can serve as the input for MapReduce jobs on the Hadoop ecosystem and it can also serve as output after the data is 
processed by MapReduce. The data can be accessed via the Java API or through the REST API or even the Thrift and AVRO gateways.
